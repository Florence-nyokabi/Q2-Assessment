# Question 1

# **Ancestral Stories:** In many African cultures, the art of storytelling is passed
# down from generation to generation. Imagine you're creating an application that
# records these oral stories and translates them into different languages. The
# stories vary by length, moral lessons, and the age group they are intended for.
# Think about how you would model `Story`, `StoryTeller`, and `Translator`
# objects, and how inheritance might come into play if there are different types of
# stories or storytellers.

# Question 2
#  **African Cuisine:** 
# You're creating a recipe app specifically for African cuisine.
# The app needs to handle recipes from different African countries, each with its
# unique ingredients, preparation time, cooking method, and nutritional
# information. Consider creating a `Recipe` class, and think about how you might
# create subclasses for different types of recipes (e.g., `MoroccanRecipe`,
# `EthiopianRecipe`, `NigerianRecipe`), each with its own unique properties and
# methods.
